# Soot Scala Demo

To run this demo, you will need docker and docker-compose on your system.

First, you need to build the docker containers with:
```
docker-compose build
```

You can then run the script `run_demo.sh`, with:
```
bash run_demo.sh
```

This will populate a folder named `output` with a variety of subfolders:

```
bytecode -- Contains disassembled Scala class files
class  -- Contains class files generated by scalac
sootOutput -- Contains Control Flow Graphs as PDFs/dot files, organized into various directory based on class/function name
```
